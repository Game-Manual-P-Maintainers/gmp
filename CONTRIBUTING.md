# Contributing

First of all, note that we have a code of conduct. Please follow it in all your interactions with gmp.

There are two primary ways to contribute to gmp. If there is a change you want to see, you can

1. Open an issue about it. If we agree, we'll just implement it for you.
2. Open a pull request. If you want to make the change directly, this is the way to go.

## Pull Request Process

1. Still open an issue about the change so we can discuss the general idea. We don't want you wasting your time on a change that might not be accepted.
2. Make the change.
3. Open a pull request.
4. Wait for a review from 2 or more developers.
5. Make edits if necessary.
6. Once we feel the PR is ready, we'll merge it.
