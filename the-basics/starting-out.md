# Starting Out

FTC programming can be confusing and scary. There are so many things to do and so many ways to do them. This part of the guide will help you through the toughest phase of your FTC programming journey: starting out.\


### Resources

Many good established resources exist that can help you move more quickly through this phase. Here are a few we recommend:

* If you are interested in learning Java, there are many resources that can help with this:
  * FreeCodeCamp ([https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp/featured](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp/featured)) has multiple videos that teach the Java language, several of which are targeted at complete beginners.
  * CodeAcademy offers free, project-based courses for Java: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)
* The official FTC Robot Controller docs provide info on every function in the library: [https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc\_app/doc/javadoc/index.html](https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc\_app/doc/javadoc/index.html)
* _FIRST_ has an official tutorial for OnBot Java, Blocks, and Android Studio. However, they are a bit confusing and somewhat outdated: [https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki)
