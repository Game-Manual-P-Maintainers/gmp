## IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio

The IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio integrated development environments (IDE) are amazing tools for developing code for your robot in Java. These 2 IDEs allow for high customization and are great for managing workflow with their built-in GIT tools. They both come preinstalled with everything you'll need to develop your code, and are somewhat trivial to set up. A major difference between these two and the previous options is that they do not build from a web browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE created by the JetBrains company. The "Ultimate" edition is paid, while the "Community" edition is free. The "Community" edition lacks some of the features present in the "Ultimate" version. Android Studio is basically just a version of the "Community" edition with a few extra plugins and features preinstalled.

### Pros

* &#x20;Allows you to code in Java, which allows for greater flexibility than blocks.
* High level of customization, with different themes and plugins available to tailor the user experience.
* Multiple ways to build code to the robot controller.
* Support for external tools and libraries like FTCLib and Roadrunner.
* Tons of resources exist for both Java and the IDEs.

### Cons

* Can be complex and difficult to understand for new users.
* If you are concerned about computer storage, then these heavy environments may cause issues.
* It can be harder to debug Java code, as it is more complex and arguably less readable than blocks.

## Alternative Programming Languages

### C/C++
