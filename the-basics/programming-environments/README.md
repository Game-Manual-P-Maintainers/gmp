# Programming Environments

To start programming, we need some sort of way to write our code and put it onto the robot. There are 3 different ways to do this: FTC Blocks, OnBot Java, and IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio.

Each of these options does things very differently from the other and choosing which one is best for you can be difficult. Here is a quick explanation of each environment, as well as the pros and cons of each.

## Blocks

FTC Blocks is a software that allows users to build code using "blocks" similar to Scratch or Blockly. Blocks are simple and easy to understand and can be picked up and used by almost anyone pretty easily. The FTC Blocks program contains all the needed tools to perform tasks with your robot and is a great way to learn about the FTC control systems.&#x20;

### Pros

* _FIRST_ officially recommends that new programmers start with blocks.
* Easy to read and debug code.

### Cons

## OnBot Java



### Pros

### Cons

## IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio

The IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio integrated development environments (IDE) are amazing tools for developing code for your robot in Java. These 2 IDEs allow for high customization and are great for managing workflow with their built-in GIT tools. They both come preinstalled with everything you'll need to develop your code and are somewhat trivial to set up. A major difference between the IDEs and the previous options is that they do not install via a web browser, instead sending an "apk" file to the robot.

{% hint style="info" %}
IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE created by the JetBrains company. The "Ultimate" edition is paid, while the "Community" edition is free. The "Community" edition lacks some of the features present in the "Ultimate" version. Android Studio is basically just a version of the "Community" edition with a few extra plugins and features preinstalled.
{% endhint %}

### Pros

* Allows you to code in Java, which allows for greater flexibility than blocks. This is great for people with some existing programming experience.
* High level of customization, with different themes and plugins available to tailor the user experience.
* Multiple ways to build code onto the robot controller.
* Support for external tools and libraries like FTCLib and Roadrunner.
* Tons of resources exist for both Java and the IDEs.

### Cons

* Can be complex and difficult to understand for new users.
* If you are concerned about computer storage, then these heavy environments may cause issues.
* It can be harder to debug Java code, as it is more complex and arguably less readable than blocks.

## Alternative Programming Languages

### C/C++
